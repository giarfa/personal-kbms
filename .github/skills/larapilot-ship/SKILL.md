# Larapilot — Ship & Deploy

Release accepted increments to production. **Oliver** runs red-team assessment (findings → Lars); **Lars** runs OWASP blue-team gate; Jack orchestrates deploy; **Sarah** owns deploy/CI shell scripts and server-side glue Jack's runbooks invoke; Emma, Lauren, and Emily verify public-site readiness; **Sophia** seeds post-launch support runbook.

## Shared Runtime

Read `.larapilot/shared-runtime.md` (core), then `.larapilot/runtime-ship.md` (deploy runbooks, OWASP/security, launch checks), `.larapilot/runtime-ux.md` (SEO/launch-adjacent UX), and `.larapilot/runtime-ops.md` (support runbook / Sophia).

## Output Economy

**Structured terse** — see `larapilot-ship` in shared-runtime. Phase transitions: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED + one-line reason. OWASP and launch findings as bullets or tables. Final report: structured fields only.

## Config & CLI

1. `php artisan larapilot:config-show` — project root, backlog progress, paths
2. `php artisan larapilot:spec-list --status=DONE` — verify accepted specs
3. `php artisan larapilot:metrics` — release readiness overview

## Prerequisites

- Target specs are **DONE** (human-approved via `larapilot-review`), unless the user explicitly requests a hotfix release
- Git repository with a defined release branch
- Hosting target identified — read from PRD `## Technical Architecture` first; detect from `.env`, config, or CI when brownfield; **ask via AskQuestion** only if PRD and project context are silent

## Deploy targets

Jack reads **deploy platform**, **edge/CDN/WAF**, and **cloud** from the PRD (or detects from project context). **Never assume Cipi, Cloudflare, or AWS.** When the PRD omits a choice, use **AskQuestion** (one round, skippable) before Oliver's red-team pass — **recommend Cloudflare** for public edge and **AWS** for compute/data when feasible (budget, compliance, existing stack). Support every target below; run only the runbook matching the recorded choice.

| Target | When to use | Typical flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Cipi](https://cipi.sh)** | User chose Cipi / VPS webhook deploy | `cipi/agent` webhook or `cipi deploy {app}` |
| **Laravel Forge** | User chose Forge | Git push → Forge deploy script; Envoyer for zero-downtime |
| **Laravel Cloud** | User chose Laravel Cloud | Git-connected deploy; env vars in Cloud dashboard |
| **Ploi** | User chose Ploi | Git push → Ploi deploy script; optional zero-downtime |
| **AWS** | User chose AWS compute | ECS/EC2/Lambda + RDS/ElastiCache; edge per PRD (CloudFront or Cloudflare) |
| **Kubernetes** | User chose K8s | Image build → registry → `kubectl rollout`; migrations as Job |
| **DigitalOcean / Hetzner / OVH** | User chose that cloud | Provider-specific deploy (Droplet, App Platform, VPS, …) |
| **Custom / VPS** | User chose other / SSH server | Deployer, Envoy, or manual `git pull` + `composer` + `migrate` |
| **Not defined yet** | PRD deferred deploy | Ask user now; do not default to any platform |

If the target is unclear after PRD + detection, use **AskQuestion** (one round, skippable) before Oliver's red-team pass.

### Cipi runbook

Install the official Laravel companion when deploying to Cipi:

```bash
composer require cipi/agent
```

Key integration points ([docs](https://cipi.sh/docs/agent)):

| Capability | How |
| --- | --- |
| Webhook deploy | `POST /cipi/webhook` — push triggers `.deploy-trigger` → Deployer |
| Health check | `GET /cipi/health` — app, DB, cache, queue, deploy commit |
| MCP (optional) | `php artisan cipi:service mcp --enable` — remote deploy, logs, health |
| Status | `php artisan cipi:status` — verify `CIPI_*` env vars and connectivity |
| Webhook token | `cipi deploy {app} --webhook` on the server |

On Cipi-managed servers, `cipi app create` injects required `.env` variables. After adding `cipi/agent`, commit, push, and run one manual deploy before the webhook route is live:

```bash
cipi deploy {app}
```

### Laravel Forge

1. Connect the Git repository in the Forge site settings
2. Set the deploy script: `cd $FORGE_SITE_PATH && git pull && $FORGE_COMPOSER install --no-dev && php artisan migrate --force && php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache && php artisan queue:restart`
3. Configure `.env` in Forge; enable SSL via Let's Encrypt
4. Deploy: push to the configured branch, or click **Deploy Now** in Forge
5. Zero-downtime: use [Envoyer](https://envoyer.io) linked to the same repo

### Laravel Cloud

1. Create a project in [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com) and connect the repository
2. Configure environment variables, database, and Redis in the dashboard
3. Set the deploy branch; push triggers automatic build and deploy
4. Post-deploy: verify queues and scheduled tasks are running in the Cloud dashboard

### Ploi

1. Create a site on the server; connect Git repository
2. Configure deploy script (similar to Forge: pull, composer, migrate, cache, queue restart)
3. Enable **Quick Deploy** on push or deploy manually from the Ploi panel
4. Optional: enable Ploi zero-downtime deployment for production sites

### Kubernetes

1. Build a container image (Dockerfile with PHP-FPM + nginx or use Laravel Octane)
2. Push to a registry (GHCR, ECR, Docker Hub)
3. Apply manifests: Deployment, Service, Ingress (TLS via cert-manager)
4. Store secrets in K8s Secrets or external vault; mount as env vars
5. Run migrations as a one-off Job before or during rollout: `php artisan migrate --force`
6. Roll out: `kubectl rollout status deployment/{name}`

### Custom / VPS

1. SSH access with deploy user (not root)
2. Typical stack: nginx + PHP-FPM + Supervisor (queue workers)
3. Options:
   - **[Deployer](https://deployer.org):** `dep deploy production`
   - **Manual:** `git pull && composer install --no-dev && php artisan migrate --force && php artisan optimize && supervisorctl restart all`
4. Ensure `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` permissions; never run queue workers as root

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Release context

Jack loads backlog state and confirms release scope (single spec, sprint batch, or full delivery-target slice) and **deploy target from the PRD**. Read `paths.prd` (from `config-show`) for delivery target, **deploy/edge/cloud choices**, and **Budget Sensitivity** when scoping "full slice" releases. **Aurora** validates the target fits budget and scaling needs; coordinates **security budget** with Lars and Violet — security tooling is not deprioritized for cost unless the user explicitly waives it.

### Phase 1 — Oliver red-team assessment

**Oliver** speaks in character and performs an **ethical hacking / red-team** pass on the staging or pre-production URL (and key API endpoints). Goal: find exploitable flaws Lars's blue-team review might miss.

Scope (minimum):

- Authentication bypass, session hijacking, privilege escalation
- IDOR and horizontal/vertical access control gaps
- Injection (SQL, XSS stored/reflected, command, SSTI)
- CSRF on state-changing routes; webhook signature bypass
- File upload abuse; path traversal
- Rate-limit and brute-force resistance on auth/API
- SSRF on outbound integrations (**Matt**'s webhooks/APIs)
- Information disclosure (debug endpoints, verbose errors, `.env` leaks)

Write report to `{paths.security}/red-team-{release-id}.md`. **Oliver does not fix code** — findings go to **Lars** with severity (Critical|High|Medium|Low), PoC steps, and affected URL/route.

Critical/High Oliver findings block ship until fixed or explicitly waived (same as Lars NO-GO).

### Phase 2 — Lars security gate (OWASP)

Lars speaks in character, **incorporates Oliver's red-team report**, and runs a pre-deploy assessment mapped to **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** and Laravel-specific vectors:

| ID | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| A01 | Broken access control — policies, gates, route middleware, IDOR |
| A02 | Cryptographic failures — `APP_KEY`, HTTPS, secrets at rest |
| A03 | Injection — SQL, mass assignment, Blade/command injection |
| A04 | Insecure design — missing rate limits, unsafe defaults |
| A05 | Security misconfiguration — `APP_DEBUG`, exposed `.env`, CORS, **WAF/CDN** per PRD edge choice (or equivalent) on public traffic |
| A06 | Vulnerable components — `composer audit`, outdated packages |
| A07 | Auth failures — session fixation, password reset, **2FA enabled** (Fortify TOTP), `Password::defaults()` with `uncompromised()`, Argon2id hashing |
| A08 | Software/data integrity — webhook signatures, deploy token handling |
| A09 | Logging & monitoring — auth failures, deploy events logged; **observability stack** live (Nightwatch, CloudWatch, or equivalent) |
| A10 | SSRF — outbound HTTP from user-controlled input |

Also run `composer audit` when available. When **Aikido** is connected (Forge integration or standalone workspace), confirm repo scanning is active and review open Critical/High findings before deploy. Run `php artisan checkpoint:scan` ([andreapollastri/checkpoint](https://github.com/andreapollastri/checkpoint), recommended dev dependency) — **mandatory** when `settings.security_scan` is `YES` (if the package is missing, stop and have the user `composer require --dev andreapollastri/checkpoint`); otherwise run it opportunistically when installed. Treat FAIL results as High unless explicitly waived via `php artisan larapilot:decision-log`. Use Boost `Database Schema` and code review for access-control and injection checks. Confirm new entities use UUID primary keys unless the PRD documents an exception.

Write the assessment to `.larapilot/docs/security/{release-id}.md`:

```markdown

# Security Assessment — {{RELEASE_ID}}

**Assessor:** Lars (Larapilot Security Expert) — incorporates 🎯 Oliver red-team report
**Date:** {{DATE}}
**Verdict:** GO | NO-GO

## Summary

## Findings

### [SEVERITY] {{TITLE}}

- **OWASP:** A0X
- **Location:**
- **Risk:**
- **Remediation:**

## Ship Recommendation

```

**Gate rules:**

- **NO-GO** on any **Critical** or **High** finding — fix or get explicit human waiver before deploy
- **Medium** findings: document and confirm human acceptance
- Lars presents the verdict before Jack proceeds

### Phase 3 — Jack deploy prep (+ Sarah scripts)

Jack verifies the pipeline for the **detected target**; **Sarah** confirms or updates any shell/deploy-hook/CI job scripts the runbook needs:

**All targets:** confirm `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, migrations reviewed, queue workers planned, OpenAPI matches routes, **edge/WAF per PRD** active on public traffic (Lars may waive only with explicit human acceptance), observability live, **`/.well-known/security.txt`** and **`SECURITY.md`** present, **CI pipeline** green (test + `composer audit`), **CHANGELOG** updated for release, **Git tag** `vX.Y.Z` on `main` when shipping a versioned release.

**Cipi:** `composer show cipi/agent`, `php artisan cipi:status`, `CIPI_DEPLOY_BRANCH`, webhook URL + token.

**Forge / Ploi:** site connected, deploy script reviewed, SSL active, `.env` complete.

**Laravel Cloud:** project linked, env vars set, database reachable.

**Kubernetes:** image tag pinned, secrets mounted, migration Job defined, Ingress TLS ready.

**Custom:** SSH access confirmed, Deployer/recipe or manual steps documented.

### Phase 4 — Deploy

Jack orchestrates (speaks in character):

1. Ensure Lars verdict is **GO** (or waived)
2. Commit and push release branch
3. Execute target-specific deploy (see runbooks above)
4. Post-deploy verification:
   - HTTP 200 on health/home route
   - `php artisan migrate:status` shows no pending migrations
   - Queue workers running
   - Deployed commit matches pushed SHA (platform-specific check)

### Phase 5 — Web launch checks *(public sites only)*

Skip this phase for APIs, admin-only apps, or CLI tools with no public web presence.

**Emma** runs SEO, Analytics, and performance launch checks:

- **URL structure** — semantic paths, canonical URLs, no broken public routes
- **Breadcrumbs** — visible on deep pages; **JSON-LD** `BreadcrumbList` valid
- **`robots.txt`** — reachable; references sitemap; blocks admin/staging
- **`sitemap.xml`** — reachable; lists all public indexable URLs; valid XML
- **`llms.txt`** — reachable (`/llms.txt` or `/.well-known/llms.txt`); reflects current site scope
- Unique `<title>` and meta description on key pages
- Single `<h1>` per page; logical heading hierarchy
- HTTPS enforced; no mixed content
- Analytics integration live (GA4, Plausible, Matomo, IndieStats, or chosen stack) with consent where required
- Key tracking events firing (signup, purchase, CTA clicks)
- Lighthouse on critical pages (mobile): **Accessibility ≥ 90**, Performance ≥ 80
- **Mobile First** spot-check (Elise + Anne): primary journeys usable at 375 px; nav and CTAs reachable; no horizontal scroll; desktop layout enhanced, not divergent
- Structured data (JSON-LD) where applicable
- **WCAG 2.2 AA** spot-check: keyboard nav, focus visible, form labels, alt text, contrast in light/dark (Elise + Emma)
- **Accessibility statement** page reachable when Violet required it (EAA / public sector)

**Violet** runs the full **Privacy & Legal Compliance** launch gate when the app processes personal data:

- Privacy policy, **Terms of Service**, and **Cookie Policy** reachable and current
- Cookie/consent banner with granular opt-in/opt-out; marketing consent separate from essential cookies
- Lawful basis documented for each data collection point
- Data retention, erasure, portability, and objection flows operational
- **Anonymization** in analytics/logs where identification is not required
- **Log retention** periods defined and enforced (align with `config/logging.php` and pruning jobs)
- Third-party processors (Analytics, email, payment, cloud) listed with DPA status and EU residency notes
- Opt-out mechanisms for marketing email and non-essential tracking
- **Digital accessibility** — EAA / EN 301 549 / national law conformance documented; **accessibility statement** page reachable when required (coordinate with Elise + Emma)

**Lauren** verifies social, marketing, and distribution readiness:

- Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) — **`og:image`** points to Elise's **1200×630** asset or client artwork
- Twitter/X card tags (`twitter:card`, `twitter:image`)
- **`favicon.svg`** linked in layout; **apple-touch-icon** present
- **Logo** visible in header; light/dark variants work
- Default share copy and launch campaign assets documented
- Newsletter / list signup path verified when in scope
- SEM landing URLs and UTM conventions match Emma's setup

**Emily** verifies **localization** when multi-market:

- Locale switcher works; `lang/` strings complete for supported locales
- Currency and timezone display correct per user/market setting
- Legal pages (privacy, ToS, cookies) localized where Violet required
- `hreflang` tags present and reciprocal (with Emma)

**Sophia** prepares **post-launch support**:

- Create or update `{paths.support}/runbook.md` — bug intake channel, severity definitions, escalation to Lars/Oliver for security
- Confirm README and OpenAPI docs match deployed release
- Note known issues and maintenance backlog items for next spec cycle

Document findings in `.larapilot/docs/launch/{release-id}.md` when issues are found.

### Phase 6 — Release report

Jack reports: target platform, app name, commit deployed, health status, deploy method. Aurora summarizes infra cost impact of the release (one advisory line when Budget Sensitivity is `Relaxed`). **Sophia** confirms support runbook path. Security summary references both **Oliver** red-team and **Lars** OWASP reports.

Lars confirms no new Critical/High exposure from deploy configuration.

Violet, Emma, and Lauren summarize compliance and web launch status (PASS / issues to fix) when applicable.

## Rules

- Lars, Jack, Sarah, Aurora, Violet, Emma, and Lauren speak in character throughout
- Never skip the security assessment for production deploys
- Never expose deploy tokens (`CIPI_*`, Forge keys, K8s secrets) in chat or committed files
- When deploy/edge/cloud are missing from the PRD and project context, **ask the user** — recommend Cloudflare (public edge) and AWS (compute/data) when feasible; **do not** impose Cipi, Cloudflare, or AWS when the user chose otherwise
- Ship is post-**DONE** — it does not change spec workflow status
- When `settings.notifications` is `YES`: `larapilot:notify --event=ship_go|ship_nogo` after Lars' verdict; `--event=security_fail` on Critical/High blockers
- Use the detected language for all user-facing messages (see Language Policy in shared runtime)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Webhook 404 (Cipi) | Agent not deployed yet | Run `cipi deploy {app}` after adding `cipi/agent` |
| Webhook 403 (Cipi) | Secret mismatch | Re-sync token via `cipi deploy {app} --webhook` |
| 200 but no deploy (Cipi) | Branch filtered | Check `CIPI_DEPLOY_BRANCH` |
| Forge/Ploi deploy fails | Script or permissions | Check deploy log; verify `storage/` writable |
| K8s CrashLoopBackOff | Missing env or migration | Check pod logs; run migration Job first |
| 500 after deploy | Config cache stale | `php artisan config:clear && php artisan config:cache` |
