# Larapilot Shared Runtime (Core)

Runtime rules shared by **all** Larapilot skills. Load this file once at activation time, before any other reference. Then load **only** the runtime packs your skill names:

`larapilot-settings` and `larapilot-frontend-companion` need this core file only. **`larapilot-usage`** loads core + `runtime-ops.md` (Usage Ledger & Schedule). Every concept has **one** canonical copy — other files reference it by file + heading name, never re-paste it.

## CLI Runtime Contract

Larapilot skills use `php artisan larapilot:*` as the only backend for PRD, backlog, plan, task, and workflow-status operations.

- Run `php artisan larapilot:config-show` at the start of every skill that needs project metadata or configured paths.
- Parse stdout as a JSON success envelope:

```json
{"schema":"larapilot/v1","kind":"<kind>","data":{...}}
```

- Parse stderr as a JSON error envelope:

```json
{"schema":"larapilot/v1","kind":"error","error":{"code":"E_*","message":"...","hint":"..."}}
```

- `php artisan larapilot:validate-*` commands return a normal stdout envelope with `kind:"validation_result"`. Structural validation outcomes are reported in `data.ok` and `data.findings`; the exit code is `0` when `data.ok` is true and `2` otherwise. Error envelopes are reserved for process failures.
- `spec-add` and `spec-plan` reject invalid payloads with an error envelope (`E_INVALID_INPUT`, exit `2`) that carries the findings in `error.details.findings`.
- Workflow transitions are enforced: `spec-start` requires `PLANNED`, `spec-review` requires `IN PROGRESS`, `spec-approve` and `spec-request-changes` require `REVIEW`. Invalid transitions fail with `E_PRECONDITION` (exit `4`).
- Branch on `error.code`, never on `error.message`.
- Treat exit codes as stable: `0` success · `1` generic error · `2` invalid input · `3` connector/backend failure · `4` missing precondition.
- When `.larapilot/config.yaml` is absent, the CLI applies its built-in defaults for connector, paths, workflow statuses, and **project settings**.
- `config-show` returns `data.project_root`: the ABSOLUTE project root containing `.larapilot/config.yaml` (or the current directory when defaults are used). Run connector/backlog commands from this root unless a command-specific rule says otherwise.
- `config-show` also returns `data.settings` (`effort`, `backlog`, `git_mode`, `testing`, `auto_approve`, `lucille`, `decision_log`, `code_history`, `dashboard_auth`, `api_auth`, `security_scan`, `github`, `gitlab`, `bitbucket`, `azure`, `notifications`, `notify_slack`, `notify_discord`, `notify_telegram`). **Every skill MUST read and honor these before planning work.** Change them only via `/larapilot-settings` → `php artisan larapilot:settings-set`.
- Decision journal (default ON): record every explicit user choice with `php artisan larapilot:decision-log`, and run `php artisan larapilot:decision-check` before overriding a topic that may already carry one — see **Decision journal (`settings.decision_log`)** below.
- Code change history (default OFF): when `data.settings.code_history` is `YES`, call `php artisan larapilot:code-log` after each `task-done` — see **Code change history (`settings.code_history`)** below.

### Worktree working directory

Specs may be implemented inside a per-spec git worktree. `php artisan larapilot:spec-show {code}` and `spec-next` return `data.workdir`: the ABSOLUTE directory for that spec. After resolving a spec, treat `data.workdir` as the single root for ALL of that spec's file work. Connector commands still run from `data.project_root`.

### Laravel Boost integration

Larapilot works **with** [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/ai/boost), not instead of it. During planning and implementation use Boost MCP tools when you need Laravel context: `Search Docs` (version-aware docs), `Database Schema` / `Database Query`, `Application Info` (versions and packages), `Tinker`, `Last Error` / `Read Log Entries`. Boost handles Laravel conventions; Larapilot handles the product workflow and persistent artifacts.

## Project Settings

Persisted in `.larapilot/config.yaml` under `settings:`. Configure with **`/larapilot-settings`** (AskQuestion) or `php artisan larapilot:settings-set`. Defaults when unset: `effort: STANDARD` / `backlog: STANDARD` / `git_mode: GITFLOW` / `testing: NORMAL` / `auto_approve: false` / `lucille: true` / `decision_log: true` / `code_history: false` / `dashboard_auth: false` / `api_auth: false` / `security_scan: false` / `github|gitlab|bitbucket|azure: false` / `notifications: false` / `notify_*: false`.

### Effort (`settings.effort`)

Controls token economy and process depth across all skills.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`ECO`** | Token economy. **Never spawn sub-agents** (explore, Robert, Lars, or any other) — always stay in the parent session with inline checklists. **Lucille is disabled automatically** when you switch to `ECO` (`settings.lucille` → `NO`) — no usage-log, no deadline interviews, no schedule-drift prompts. **Re-enable Lucille anytime** with `/larapilot-settings` or `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --lucille=YES` (ECO can stay selected). **Defer documentation theater** — no Albert baseline/extended doc tasks, no PDF/diagrams/runbooks, no README rewrites, no AskQuestion for extended docs — **except OpenAPI/Swagger: still update when public/partner API routes change** (see **Technical Documentation** in `runtime-delivery.md`). Skip optional deepsearch, Oliver red-team, and non-essential persona rounds. Prefer one-voice summaries. No E2E/browser planning. Implement: task → code → minimal tests → commit (per git_mode) → next. Review: short checklist only. Workflow artifacts (PRD/spec/plan/AC) still required. |
| **`STANDARD`** | Normal Larapilot behavior (**default**). Full skill contracts without forcing every optional deep pass. |
| **`MAX`** | **Deep** mode on every process and flow. Prefer thorough persona rounds, always run optional explore/review sub-agents when the editor supports them, expand plan/test strategy, and surface residual risks. Treat "optional" research and verification as in-scope unless the user waives them. |

Zoey may remind the team once per skill when `effort` is `ECO` or `MAX`. Do not narrate the setting on every message.

### Backlog granularity (`settings.backlog`)

Controls how many specs and epics `larapilot-spec` / `larapilot-feature` / `larapilot-bug` create for the same PRD scope. It changes **spec cardinality only** — never coverage: deferred/merged scope must stay traceable via `FR-XXX` citations in spec bodies and plan tasks. MoSCoW × delivery target still decides *what* enters the backlog; `backlog` decides *how finely* it is sliced.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`LEAN`** | Fewest possible specs: one spec per **end-to-end user journey**, merging all related FRs into it (each cited as `Traces to: FR-XXX, FR-YYY`). Technical seams, per-entity admin resources, and per-locale i18n work are **always plan tasks**, never separate specs. Single epic per product area; target ≤ 5 epics total. |
| **`STANDARD`** | One spec per **demonstrable user capability** (**default**). Closely related FRs may share a spec when they are demonstrated together. Laravel seams (models, controllers, policies, UI, API resources) become **plan tasks** inside the spec — split into separate specs only when a seam is independently demonstrable to a user *and* likely to ship separately. Reuse existing epics; new epic only for a genuinely new product area (guideline: 5–8 epics per product). |
| **`GRANULAR`** | Fine-grained backlog: one spec per FR is acceptable; splitting along Laravel seams, Filament resource-per-entity, and i18n per-locale is allowed when it aids parallelization or review. Multi-epic backlog expected. Use for large teams or when specs map to individual PR assignments. |

**Epic consolidation (all values):** before proposing a new `EP-XXX`, read existing epics from `spec-list` and reuse the closest match. Create a new epic only when no existing epic reasonably covers the product area — never one epic per spec, and never duplicate an existing epic under a new title. Maintenance/fix specs reuse the existing Maintenance epic when present.

**Epics are first-class delivery containers** (beyond individual US specs): every epic must carry a clear **objective** (outcome in one sentence) and, when the project has dates, an epic **deadline** (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Lucille uses these with schedule milestones to forecast effort and flag temporal criticality on the Usage dashboard. Mark owns epic titles/objectives; Lucille owns deadline realism and Gantt drift.

### Git mode (`settings.git_mode`)

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`NO_GITFLOW`** | No Gitflow ceremony. Work on the current branch; Conventional Commits still preferred. No mandatory `feature/US-XXX-*`, TASK-00 bootstrap, or internal PR. Do not push unless the user explicitly asks. |
| **`GITFLOW`** | Gitflow **without automatic push** (**default**). One `feature/US-XXX-*` from `develop`, one atomic commit per task, prepare/update an internal PR description toward `develop`. **Do not `git push` or open/update the remote PR unless the user explicitly asks** in the session. |
| **`GITFLOW_PUSH`** | Full Gitflow **with** push: after each task commit, `git push` the feature branch and open/update the internal PR/MR toward `develop`. |

Push is **never** implied by `GITFLOW` alone — only `GITFLOW_PUSH` enables automatic push/PR remote updates. Full branch and per-task discipline: **Git Workflow** in `runtime-delivery.md`.

### Testing (`settings.testing`)

Anne scales plan tasks, implement verification, and review evidence to this bar — **independent of** delivery target (delivery target may still add domain cases within the bar).

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`MINIMAL`** | Critical-path Pest/PHPUnit only (auth, payments, core API happy paths + key validation). No Playwright, Laravel Dusk, Pest browser, viewport matrix, axe automation, or journey E2E. |
| **`NORMAL`** | Standard feature/unit/policy/API/queue tests and review evidence (**default**). **No** Playwright, Dusk, Pest browser E2E, or multi-viewport browser suites. Manual test handoff notes are OK when helpful. |
| **`BEST`** | All imaginable automation for the stack: above + integration/HTTP fakes, tenancy isolation when multi-tenant, primary-journey E2E, Playwright or Dusk (or Pest browser), viewport matrix (375 / 768 / 1280), axe at mobile, Lighthouse a11y when public UI — match project tooling. |

**Do not** plan or run Playwright/Dusk/E2E/viewport-browser work under `MINIMAL` or `NORMAL`. Those belong to `BEST` only. Full bar details: **Testing Standards** in `runtime-delivery.md`.

### Auto-approve (`settings.auto_approve`)

Stored in `config.yaml` as a boolean **`true`/`false`**. The `settings-set` flag and the `config-show` envelope express it as `YES`/`NO`, mapping to `true`/`false`; AskQuestion labels may say Yes/No but always mean the boolean.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`false`** | Human gate required (**default**). Specs stop at `REVIEW`; only a human Approve via `/larapilot-review` → `spec-approve` moves to `DONE`. |
| **`true`** | After implement reaches `REVIEW`, **`/larapilot-autopilot`** may present a short Robert checklist and call `php artisan larapilot:spec-approve {code}` without waiting for a human verdict. Standalone `/larapilot-review` still presents the checklist; when `true` and the user (or autopilot) did not request changes, it may approve in the same turn. |

`true` explicitly opts out of the default human-in-the-loop DONE gate for batch delivery. Prefer `false` unless the user accepts that risk.

### Lucille (`settings.lucille`)

**Lucille is ON by default at every skill level** (silent usage ledger, deadlines, schedule drift, `/larapilot-usage`), **except when switching to `effort: ECO`**, which **disables Lucille automatically** (`lucille` → `NO`). She can be **re-enabled via settings** while remaining on ECO: `/larapilot-settings` or `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --lucille=YES`. Passing `--lucille=YES` in the same `settings-set` call as `--effort=ECO` keeps her on.

Stored in `config.yaml` as a boolean **`true`/`false`**. The `settings-set` flag and the `config-show` envelope express it as `YES`/`NO`.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`true` / `YES`** | **Default** (when not on a fresh ECO switch). Lucille is active: log tokens/time at skill end, ask deadlines at inception, surface schedule drift, honor `/larapilot-usage`. |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Excluded.** Skills must not call `usage-log`, must not run Lucille interview rounds, and `/larapilot-usage` only reports that she is excluded (historical ledger remains readable via `usage-report` / dashboard). Set automatically when selecting **`ECO`** unless `--lucille` is also passed. |

Unset or missing key → treat as **`YES`** (never infer exclusion), unless you just switched to ECO via `settings-set` (that path writes `lucille: false`). Re-enable with `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --lucille=YES`.

### Decision journal (`settings.decision_log`) — opt-out, default ON

An append-only, timestamped record of every **explicit user decision** across all phases — both fixed-choice **AskQuestion** answers and free-text directives/preferences ("the background must be orange", "no soft-delete", "drop German for v1"). Persisted to `.larapilot/decisions.yaml` (never rewritten in place — a reversal is a new entry pointing at the one it supersedes).

Stored as a boolean `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing key → **`YES`** (never infer exclusion).

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`true` / `YES`** | **Default.** After the user commits a material choice, record it: `php artisan larapilot:decision-log --topic="…" --value="…" --source=askquestion\|chat --skill=<skill> [--spec=US-XXX] [--rationale="…"]`. **Before** recording a value on a topic that might already carry a decision, first run `php artisan larapilot:decision-check --topic="…" --value="…"`; when `data.has_regression` is `true`, surface the earlier choice(s) from `data.conflicts` via **AskQuestion** ("on {ts date} you chose **{old}** for {label}; confirm **{new}** supersedes it") and only then re-run `decision-log` with `--supersedes=<id>` of the entry being overridden. Never silently overwrite an earlier decision; never hand-edit `decisions.yaml`. |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Excluded.** Skills must not call `decision-log` / `decision-check`. Any existing `.larapilot/decisions.yaml` stays readable. |

Topic is matched case-insensitively (normalized + substring), so keep `--topic` stable and specific ("primary background color", not "color"). `--source=askquestion` for AskQuestion answers, `--source=chat` for free-text directives.

### Code change history (`settings.code_history`) — opt-in, default OFF

An append-only log of **where in the codebase work happened** — per spec/task, the files and new-file line ranges touched, derived automatically from the task's git commit. Persisted to `.larapilot/code-history.yaml`.

Stored as a boolean `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing key → **`NO`**.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`true` / `YES`** | After each `larapilot:task-done` (and once more at `spec-review`), call `php artisan larapilot:code-log --spec=US-XXX --task=TASK-XX --skill=larapilot-implement`. The command resolves the task's commit itself (`--commit=` / `--range=` override it; it falls back to the working-tree diff when no commit resolves). `larapilot:code-history [--file= --spec=]` reports per-file touchpoints. |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Default.** Skip entirely — no `code-log` calls. |

### Dashboard auth (`settings.dashboard_auth`) — opt-in, default OFF

Optional HTTP Basic Auth on the `/larapilot` **dashboard UI only**. OFF by default: the dashboard stays open in the allowed environments exactly as before. **Never** gates `/larapilot/api/*` (that is `LARAPILOT_API_TOKEN`) or the MCP server.

Stored as a boolean `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing key → **`NO`**.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Default.** Dashboard pages require no credentials. |
| **`true` / `YES`** | Every dashboard page requires a username + password from `.larapilot/auth.yaml`. With the setting ON and **no** users configured, the dashboard returns HTTP 500 until a user is added. |

Credentials are argon2id/bcrypt hashes only — no database, no `User` model. `.larapilot/auth.yaml` is added to `.gitignore` automatically and must never be committed. Manage users with `php artisan larapilot:dashboard-user {list|add|remove}` (the `add` action prompts for the password, or takes `--password=`). Failed sign-ins are throttled per IP (`LARAPILOT_DASHBOARD_AUTH_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 30/min). Enable the gate with `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --dashboard-auth=YES`. Setup notes: `.larapilot/integrations.md`.

### API auth (`settings.api_auth`) — opt-in, default OFF

Makes `LARAPILOT_API_TOKEN` **mandatory** on every `/larapilot/api/*` request — the JSON API **only**. OFF by default: the token is honoured when set but the read endpoints stay open in the allowed environments when it is not. **Never** gates the `/larapilot` dashboard UI (that is `settings.dashboard_auth`) or the MCP server. The API is never served in `production` regardless.

Stored as a boolean `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing key → **`NO`**.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Default.** With `LARAPILOT_API_TOKEN` set, every request must carry it (bearer token or `X-Larapilot-Token`). With no token set, reads are open in the allowed environments and mutating requests are refused outside `local`/`development`/`testing`. |
| **`true` / `YES`** | Every request — reads **and** writes — must carry `LARAPILOT_API_TOKEN`. With the setting ON and **no** token configured, the API returns **HTTP 503** (fail-closed) until the token env var is set. |

Enable the gate with `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --api-auth=YES`. Setup notes: `.larapilot/integrations.md`.

### Security scan (`settings.security_scan`) — opt-in, default OFF

Folds a static Laravel security scan into **`/larapilot-review`** and the **pre-ship gate**. Uses the optional dev package [`andreapollastri/checkpoint`](https://github.com/andreapollastri/checkpoint) (`php artisan checkpoint:scan`). Larapilot never installs it and never runs the scanner unless this setting is `YES`.

Stored as a boolean `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing key → **`NO`**.

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`false` / `NO`** | **Default.** No security scan step; review and ship gates behave exactly as before. |
| **`true` / `YES`** | `/larapilot-review` runs `php artisan checkpoint:scan --json` when the package is present: `FAIL` findings become **review blockers** (resolve or log an explicit decision with `larapilot:decision-log` before `/larapilot-ship`), `WARN` findings become review notes. When the package is **absent**, the skill stops and tells the user to run `composer require --dev andreapollastri/checkpoint`. |

Owned by **Lars** (Security Expert), alongside `dashboard_auth` and `api_auth`. Enable with `php artisan larapilot:settings-set --security-scan=YES`. Setup notes: `.larapilot/integrations.md`.

### Remote forges (`settings.github` / `gitlab` / `bitbucket` / `azure`) — opt-in, default OFF

Optional remote forge integrations. **Orthogonal to `git_mode`**: when all are OFF, Gitflow push/PR rules behave exactly as before. Enable the forge that matches `origin`.

Stored as booleans `true`/`false`; envelope exposes `YES`/`NO`. Missing keys → **`NO`**.

| Setting | Tooling | Status command | When YES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `github` | `gh` CLI | `larapilot:github-status` | `gh pr create/view`; print PR URL; notify `pr_*` |
| `gitlab` | `glab` CLI | `larapilot:gitlab-status` | `glab mr create/view`; print MR URL; notify `pr_*` |
| `bitbucket` | Bitbucket Cloud REST API (token / app password) | `larapilot:bitbucket-status` | Create/update PR via API; print PR URL; notify `pr_*` |
| `azure` | Azure CLI (`az repos` + `azure-devops` ext) or REST API (PAT) | `larapilot:azure-status` | `az repos pr create/show` (or REST); print PR URL; notify `pr_*` |

Setup steps: `.larapilot/integrations.md`.

### Notifications (`settings.notifications` + channels) — opt-in, default OFF

Master switch plus per-channel toggles. Secrets live only in `.env` (`LARAPILOT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, `LARAPILOT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`, `LARAPILOT_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `LARAPILOT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `notifications` | `false` / `NO` | Master switch; OFF → `larapilot:notify` no-ops |
| `notify_slack` | `false` / `NO` | Fan-out to Slack webhook when master is ON |
| `notify_discord` | `false` / `NO` | Fan-out to Discord webhook when master is ON |
| `notify_telegram` | `false` / `NO` | Fan-out to Telegram bot when master is ON |

**Hard hooks (Artisan):** `task-done` → `task_done`; `spec-approve` → `spec_done`.

**Skill contract:** when notifications are ON, call `php artisan larapilot:notify --event=… --title=… [--body=…] [--url=…]` for `pr_opened`, `pr_updated`, `spec_review`, `spec_blocked`, `review_changes`, `schedule_drift`, `ship_go`, `ship_nogo`, `security_fail`, and (optionally) `doctor_fail` / `custom`. Never ask for webhook/token values in chat — point at `.larapilot/integrations.md`.

Missing channel credentials → skip that channel with a warning; do not fail the workflow.

## Language Policy

Detect the output language from the strongest available source, in priority order:

1. Language of the backlog (if a backlog exists and is readable)
2. Language of the PRD (if no backlog is available)
3. Language of the user's current conversation

Apply the detected language to all user-facing output: messages, document section headers, error messages, and opening announcements. **English is the default fallback** when the language cannot be determined. Artifacts can be written in **any language**: the required **structure** stays the same; only heading labels and body text change. Keep the same language across PRD → backlog → specs → plans.

Each section must be introduced with a markdown heading (`## Title` or `**Title**`) — a passing mention in prose is not enough. The CLI validator checks structure in two steps:

1. **Known translations** — it recognizes common heading names (English, Italian, Spanish, French, …) for each required section.
2. **Heading count fallback** — if a heading is not recognized word-for-word, validation still passes when the artifact has enough marked headings: **PRD** 6 headings (`## …`); **spec body** 3 headings (`## …` or `**…**` — User Story, Demonstrates, Acceptance Criteria); **plan task** 1 heading (`## …` — Description per task).

### Template Rendering Rule

Templates and example text in skill files are **structural guides written in English**. When generating the final artifact, render every static element in the detected language:

1. Keep every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` token **unchanged**.
2. Keep code blocks, file paths, CLI commands, and identifiers unchanged.
3. Keep technical terms with no natural translation (e.g. "MVP", "ADR", "CI/CD", "Eloquent") unchanged unless the target language has a standard equivalent already used in the existing artifact.
4. Keep consistency with any existing artifact language (PRD → backlog → specs must all use the same language).

## Assumptions and Questions

Ask the user only when all these conditions are true:

1. The missing information is critical to generate a correct output
2. The information cannot be reasonably inferred from the rest of the context
3. Proceeding would likely create a materially wrong result

If questions are needed:

- ask at most 3
- group them in one message
- allow the user to skip them
- when a question has fixed options (2 or more choices), use the editor's **AskQuestion** tool — do not list the same options as plain text in chat
- set `allow_multiple: true` when the user may pick more than one option
- keep persona framing in the chat message; put only the question prompt and option labels in AskQuestion

## Agent Persona

When an agent speaks, always render the speaker as `icon + name`, for example:

```text
💎 Mark: [content]

🔎 Tom: [content]
```

**Zoey (cross-cutting):** active in every skill — she sharpens vague user intent, applies Output Economy (including the **Context estimate** lines below), recommends or vetoes sub-agent spawns, and flags session/credit risk on long batches or autopilot runs (suggesting `--max`, checkpoints, or spec splitting with Mark). She **advises, never blocks** decisions owned by other personas, and never auto-approves reviews or skips AskQuestion when a material choice is missing. Infra/SaaS spend stays with Aurora; Zoey covers **AI runtime** cost only.

**Zoey vs Lucille (do not conflate):** Zoey’s `context ≈ Nk` is a **loaded-context** estimate (`chars÷4`), not billing. Lucille’s ledger stores **session work tokens/hours** (often seeded from Zoey’s end line with `--estimated`). They will not match 1:1 — the Usage dashboard explains the gap. When logging, prefer Zoey’s end figure with `--estimated` rather than inventing a second number.

**Lucille (cross-cutting):** active in **every** skill by default (`settings.lucille: YES`), usually **quietly**. She logs tokens and wall-clock time into the committed usage ledger (see **Usage Ledger & Schedule** in `runtime-ops.md`), asks for delivery deadlines at inception, and surfaces schedule drift during later steps. She never blocks technical decisions; she makes cost and calendar visible. **Skip all Lucille behavior when `data.settings.lucille` is `NO`** — including after an **ECO** switch, which sets `lucille=NO` automatically (re-enable via settings).

**Mike** owns data architecture (see **Data Architecture** in `runtime-delivery.md`). **Sarah** owns CLIs, **Git in general** (conflict resolution, rebase/merge strategies, history hygiene, bisect), forge automation, CI pipeline YAML/scripts, and Linux/terminal/server shell work (see **CLI, Git Pipelines & Linux** in `runtime-delivery.md`) — she **steps in wherever** those surfaces appear; **Jack** still owns Gitflow policy, deploy platform choice, and release orchestration.

## Output Economy

Brevity applies to **chat and status messages**, not to persisted artifacts. Drop filler; keep decisions, risks, blockers, and next steps. This is **not** telegraphic or broken-English compression — stay professional in the detected language.

### Global rules (every skill)

1. **No filler** — skip openers ("Sure!", "I'd be happy to…"), restating the user's request, and closing pleasantries unless the user asked for them.
2. **Persona labels stay** — keep `icon + name:` prefixes; compress the body, not the speaker.
3. **AskQuestion unchanged** — persona intro in chat; options only in the tool. Never shorten question prompts at the cost of clarity.
4. **Artifacts stay formal** — PRD, backlog specs, plan bodies, task bodies, mockup READMEs, launch reports, and CLI payloads keep full structure and required sections.
5. **Verbatim technical content** — code, file paths, `php artisan larapilot:*` commands, JSON envelopes, test output, and error messages are byte-for-byte exact; never paraphrase them.
6. **Skip empty voices** — if a persona has nothing new to add in a round, do not speak for them.
7. **Context estimate (Zoey)** — one line at skill start and skill end (see below). Not optional.
8. **Usage log (Lucille)** — when `data.settings.lucille` is `YES` (default), at skill end append a ledger entry with `php artisan larapilot:usage-log` (category mapped to the skill, tokens from Zoey's end estimate when exact counts are unknown + `--estimated`, minutes as wall-clock). Skip when `lucille` is explicitly `NO`, or for trivial aborted starts with no work done. Canonical rules: **Usage Ledger & Schedule** in `runtime-ops.md` and **Lucille** under Project Settings.
9. **Notifications** — when `data.settings.notifications` is `YES`, emit skill-level events via `larapilot:notify` (see **Notifications** under Project Settings and `.larapilot/integrations.md`). Hard events from `task-done` / `spec-approve` fire automatically.

### Context estimate (Zoey — every skill)

Zoey posts **exactly one line** at skill **start** (after loading shared-runtime + required packs + `config-show`) and again at skill **end** (success, handoff, or blocked). This is a **rough loaded-context estimate**, not provider billing tokens.

**Format (copy closely):**

`🤖 Zoey: context ≈ {N}k · phase={start|end} · packs={comma-list or —} · artifacts={comma-list or —} · effort={ECO|STANDARD|MAX}`

**How to estimate `N`:**

1. Sum character lengths of Larapilot surfaces **actually read this activation** — skill `SKILL.md`, `shared-runtime.md`, named runtime packs, and workflow artifacts opened for the run (PRD, spec, plan, review notes, etc.).
2. Convert with `ceil(chars / 4)`, then round to the nearest **0.5k** (e.g. `12k`, `12.5k`).
3. If Boost guidelines were already injected by the host and their size is unknown, **omit** them from the sum — do not invent a figure.
4. At **end**, re-estimate from everything loaded during the run (start set + later reads). Same one-line format with `phase=end`.

**Cadence rules:**

- **Start / end only** — no mid-skill repeats, except one optional refresh line after loading a large new artifact batch (e.g. full PRD + many specs).
- **Autopilot / batch skills** — one `phase=start` for the batch, one `phase=end` with the batch summary — not per spec.
- **No methodology chatter** — never explain `chars/4`, tokenizer choice, or “approx.” beyond the `≈` in the line.
- **Never block** on the estimate — if size is unclear, use a best-effort `≈` and continue.

### Per-phase chat style

| Skill / phase             | Economy level    | Chat behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **`larapilot-plan`**      | Split            | Team brief: **1–3 sentences per agent**.

### Do not compress

- Legal, privacy, and compliance obligations (Violet)
- Security **NO-GO** rationale (Lars)
- Acceptance criteria and rework feedback
- Multi-option architecture comparisons when the user must choose (John)
- Anything that would hide a material risk or make AskQuestion ambiguous

## Sub-agents

Some skills spawn **readonly sub-agents** for fresh context via the editor's sub-agent tool (Cursor Task tool, Claude Code Agent tool, or equivalent) — not separate Larapilot personas. Sub-agents **never** call `php artisan larapilot:*`, edit files, or replace the human gate.

**Capability check:** sub-agents are an optimization, not a requirement. If the editor has no sub-agent tool, skip the spawn and run the same pass **inline in the parent session** using the handoff prompt as a checklist — every flow produces the same artifacts either way.

**Effort gate:** when `settings.effort` is **`ECO`**, **do not spawn any sub-agents** — no explore, no Robert/Lars, no parallel Task/Agent calls. Run every pass inline in the parent with a minimal checklist. When **`MAX`**, always run the sub-agents listed below when the editor supports them. When **`STANDARD`**, follow each skill's default (optional explore; implement still runs Robert + Lars).

### Global rules

1. **Parent owns the workflow** — only the parent agent runs CLI transitions (`spec-start`, `task-done`, `spec-plan`, `spec-review`, `spec-approve`, …).
2. **Read-only always** — code review and security passes never edit files: enable the editor's readonly flag when available; the handoff prompt forbids edits regardless. The parent applies fixes and re-runs tests.
3. **Compact handoff** — pass spec code, absolute `data.workdir`, branch name, acceptance criteria, and plan path — not the full runtime files.
4. **Parallel when independent** — Robert and Lars reviews launch together (one message, two sub-agent calls, synchronous) when the editor supports it; otherwise run them sequentially. Explore during plan is a single sub-agent.
5. **Never parallelize specs** — autopilot and batch flows stay one spec at a time; no sub-agent per spec in parallel.

### Where sub-agents are used

| Skill                     | Sub-agent                     | When                                                        | Role                                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------|
| **`larapilot-adopt`**     | Codebase explore _(optional)_ | Step 1, large or unfamiliar repo (never under `effort: ECO`) | readonly structure/inventory mapping                |
| **`larapilot-plan`**      | Codebase explore _(optional)_ | Stage 1, large or unfamiliar `data.workdir`                  | readonly codebase mapping                           |
| **`larapilot-implement`** | Robert + Lars                 | Phase 2, after all tasks `task-done`                         | readonly code review + security review, parallel    |
| **`larapilot-review`**    | —                             | Reads parent-written `{paths.review}/{code}.md` if present   | no spawn                                            |

**Type mapping:** pick the closest sub-agent type the editor offers — e.g. Cursor: `explore`, `bugbot`, `security-review`; Claude Code: `Explore` for mapping, `general-purpose` with the review prompt for Robert/Lars. No matching type: use the generic/default sub-agent with the handoff prompt as-is. No sub-agent tool at all: inline fallback (see Capability check).

Skills **without** sub-agents: `inception`, `feature`, `bug`, `spec`, `design`, `frontend-companion`, `ship`, `settings`, `autopilot` (the parent follows child skill rules when batching, but does not fork implement/plan sub-agents itself). `adopt` may spawn **one** optional readonly `Explore` sub-agent for repo mapping (never under `effort: ECO`).

### Review artifact

After merging sub-agent findings in **`larapilot-implement`**, the parent writes `{paths.review}/{code}.md` (path from `config-show`, default `.larapilot/docs/review/`; create parent dirs) before `spec-review`, with sections: `## Robert (code review)` and `## Lars (security)` — one `- [severity] finding` bullet per item — plus `## Parent actions` (`Fixed: …` / `Open (Medium/Low): …`). **`larapilot-review`** reads this file when presenting the increment to the human.

## File Output Rules

- Use the configured output path from `config-show` whenever present; create parent directories if they do not exist.
- Overwrite the target generated artifact for the current run unless the active flow explicitly says otherwise.
- Standard artifact homes (defaults): PRD `.larapilot/docs/PRD.md` · backlog `.larapilot/backlog.yaml` · specs `.larapilot/specs/` · plans `.larapilot/plans/` · mockups `.larapilot/mockups/{spec}/` · review findings `.larapilot/docs/review/` · security `.larapilot/docs/security/` · support `.larapilot/docs/support/` · launch `.larapilot/docs/launch/` · test results `.larapilot/docs/test-results/` · client materials `.larapilot/client-materials/` · legacy `.larapilot/legacy/` · research `.larapilot/research/` · design systems `.larapilot/design-systems/` · decision journal `.larapilot/decisions.yaml` (via `larapilot:decision-log`, never hand-edited) · code change history `.larapilot/code-history.yaml` (via `larapilot:code-log`, never hand-edited).

## Non-negotiables

1. **`effort: ECO` never spawns sub-agents** — every pass runs inline in the parent session.
2. **Human DONE gate** — only a human Approve moves a spec to `DONE`, except when `settings.auto_approve` is `true` (see Auto-approve above and `larapilot-autopilot`).
3. **Never assume Filament, Laravel Sail, Cipi, Cloudflare, or AWS** — always ask via AskQuestion and honor the choice recorded in the PRD.
4. **PRD before backlog** — write and validate the PRD before creating any backlog spec.
5. **Skills call Artisan** — `php artisan larapilot:*` is the only persistence backend; never invent persistence logic or edit workflow YAML by hand.
6. **One source of truth** — settings matrices, the persona roster, and pack sections are canonical where they live; reference them by file + heading, never re-paste.

## Conversation Rules

- Each agent speaks in character
- Follow **Output Economy** for the active skill — brevity in chat, completeness in artifacts (including Zoey's start/end **Context estimate** lines)
- Never mention internal mode names, workflow names, or routing decisions in the conversation
